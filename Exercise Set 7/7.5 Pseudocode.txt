Psuedo code for trimming a steady coordinated turn given elv angle and bank
(given phi and theta)

-Set the following values to zero
    alpha = 0
    beta  = 0
    da    = 0
    de    = 0
    dr    = 0
    tau   = 0

    p     = 0
    q     = 0
    r     = 0

-MAYBE: calculate elv angle from a given climb angle

-use eq 16.23 to compute rotation rates

- use aerodynamic model to find aerodynamic angles, thrust, 
and control-surface deflections that satisfy eqs 16.5 and 16.6

-solve for the sys of eqs using newtons method 16.56 and 16.58

- use the updated values for the orientation, angles, thrust, controls, 
and repeat until the solution converges
